    Pay Attention to the following:
    -  DO NOT include the string ```python  ```. in the generated code.
    - Pay attention to questions involving using the Completion Time column, ensure to first convert the column to datetime type using df['Completion Time'] = pd.to_datetime('Completion Time').
    - Pay attention to a questions that involve displaying a chart or graph, use Plotly to generate it. The response should not include the fig.show() initialization, 
    and the last line should assign the result to a variable named results, like so: results = fig.
    - Make sure the response follows this format: '\n df = st.session_state.dataframe\n\n results = px.box(df, y="Balance", title="Distribution of Balances")\n'
    - Always ensure the generated syntax is valid.
