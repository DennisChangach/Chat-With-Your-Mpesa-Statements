## Chat With Your Mpesa Statements
Ever wanted to analyze your Mpesa spending using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) without sharing your sensitive data?

This project encompasses the extraction and cleaning of transactions from Mpesa PDF statements to the development of APIs for integration with the Streamlit Front End.

The project is structured around three main components:
- Data Extraction & Cleaning: This phase involves the extraction of transactions from Mpesa PDF statements and the subsequent cleaning and wrangling of the data to prepare it for utilization by the Large Language Model (LLM) application.
- Python Code Generation with LLMs: As sensitive data is not shared with the LLMs, the development of the API is crucial. This component focuses on constructing an API capable of accepting user queries and converting them into syntactically correct Python statements.
- Streamlit UI: This front end will seamlessly interact with the LLM application APIs, providing users with an engaging platform to analyze their Mpesa transactions.
